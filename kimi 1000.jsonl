I’ve folded in the new kinetic data you asked for and updated the catalytic turnover graphs (Figure 4b). Could you skim the attached “manuscript_updates.docx” and let me know if the catalyst stability paragraph on page 6 is clear? The NSF program officer wants the camera-ready version back by 3 p.m. today so we can stay on track for the $5 M Year-2 release.\n\nIf anything looks off, just drop a quick comment in Track Changes.

I just got off the phone with the JoAH editorial office—turns out they need our final camera-ready manuscript 48 hours earlier than we thought. They're putting the coral restoration special issue to bed next week and slipped the deadline on us.\n\nI've folded in all the post-review changes we discussed last Tuesday, including the new SEM images from the mesocosm trials and the updated statistical model that accounts for the 0.3°C temperature differential you spotted. The only thing still missing is your latest paragraph on the Global Education Initiative grant implications—could you drop that into the attached manuscript_updates.docx and bounce it back ASAP? The file has tracked changes on so you can see what I've tweaked.\n\nThey're particularly keen on the section linking our coral larval settlement rates to adolescent health outcomes, so if you could beef that up with a sentence or two about the broader environmental health implications, that would seal it. I know it's short notice, but if we miss this slot we'll be pushed to the September issue.\n\nShoot it back when ready and I'll compile the final package tonight.\n\nThanks,\nDavid\n\nDr. David Chen\nAssociate Research Scientist\nAncient Scrolls University, Marine Biology Department\nORCID: 0000-0002-1825-0097", "timestamp": 1756447219.034982, "model_used": "kimi-k2-0711-preview"}

Could you please review the highlighted sections in manuscript_updates.docx? I’ve added track changes so you can see exactly where the numbers diverge from our original submission. \n\nThe Journal of Marine Ecosystems committee reached out this morning asking for our final abstract by Thursday noon, and I’m worried this discrepancy might raise red flags during your keynote next month.
